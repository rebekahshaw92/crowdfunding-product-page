### Built with

- JavaScript

### What I Learned

When undertaking this project I was able to continue to work with Bootstrap 5 and JavaScript. I learn how to check if a value is present with an htmol and covert it to any array using JavaScript so that I was able to disable a button. This was somthing I didn't know about before working on this project.

### Continued Development

I would like to continue working on this project by add an error message if they do not input a number when enetering the value they want to  pledge. I would also like to like to lower the number of items left each time the user makes a pledge.

### Userful Resources 

- [Bootstrap]https://getbootstrap.com) - This site helped me learn all I needed to know about Bootstrap.
